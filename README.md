# 📱 AR Labeling on the Internet Computer (ICP)

## 🧠 Project Idea: Augmented Reality Object Labeling

This project aims to create an **Augmented Reality (AR)** application that allows users to place **virtual labels** on real-world objects using their mobile phone cameras. Built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, the system utilizes blockchain-backed persistence to store and sync labels across devices securely and transparently.

## 🔍 Use Cases

### 🏠 Personal Use
- Label your **wallet**, **keys**, **documents**, or any important item to remember where you placed it.
- Add reminders or notes to specific physical locations or objects in your home.

### 🛍️ Business Use
- If you own a **clothing shop**, you can attach virtual **price tags**, **descriptions**, or **promotions** directly to your displayed items.
- Enhance the customer shopping experience with AR-driven product information without any physical signage.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Object Detection and Anchoring**
   - The mobile app uses the camera and AR capabilities to anchor virtual labels in 3D space relative to physical environments.
   - Each label is **static**, meaning it is pinned to a specific location (not to the object if it moves).

2. **Label Creation**
   - Users can create a label by pointing the camera at a desired location and entering a name, description, or price.
   - The label is saved and anchored to that physical space.

3. **Persistence via ICP**
   - Labels are stored on the **Internet Computer** using canisters (smart contracts).
   - This ensures **secure, decentralized storage** and **easy retrieval** of labels across sessions and devices.

4. **Manual Label Management**
   - Since labels are static, users must **manually remove or update** labels if the object is moved.
   - This keeps the system simple and avoids the complexity of real-time object tracking.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter or React Native (for mobile AR)
- **AR Engine**: ARCore (Android) / ARKit (iOS)
- **Backend**: Internet Computer (ICP) with Motoko or Rust-based canisters
- **Storage**: Decentralized label metadata stored in ICP smart contracts
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity or other decentralized login

## ✅ Features

- 📌 Anchor labels in 3D space using mobile AR
- 🔐 Secure, blockchain-based storage of label data
- 🔄 Cross-device synchronization using ICP
- 🖊️ Easy creation, editing, and deletion of labels
- 🛍️ Business-friendly for showcasing product info in AR

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- Labels do **not follow moving objects**.
- Anchors may shift slightly depending on lighting and tracking quality.
- Manual removal is required if the object is moved.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
